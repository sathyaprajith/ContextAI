[00:00] Alice:
Good morning, everyone. Let’s quickly sync on our ContextAI progress. The hackathon is coming up, so we need a polished demo.

[00:12] Bob:
Yeah, I finished stabilizing the WhatsApp integration. We’re able to fetch all 340 chats consistently now, no random disconnects.

[00:25] Charlie:
Nice. Did you also fix the Puppeteer memory issue?

[00:31] Bob:
Yep. I added an auto-restart wrapper and reduced headless overhead. Sessions persist through .wwebjs_auth, so it’s smooth.

[00:48] Diana:
Great progress. I tested the RAG server yesterday. Retrieval works, but the event extraction still misses some decisions, especially when the phrasing is indirect.

[01:02] Alice:
Example?

[01:04] Diana:
Like “I think using React for the dashboard makes sense” — the model doesn’t classify it as a DECISION. It tags it as FACT.

[01:19] Charlie:
We can add a small rule-based post-processor. If multiple speakers agree in nearby messages, mark as DECISION.

[01:30] Alice:
Yes, let’s do that. Also—Deep Research mode is amazing, but it takes around 12 seconds. Is that acceptable for the demo?

[01:42] Bob:
I think so. Hackathon judges won’t mind a 10-second wait for a 1000-word intelligence summary.

[01:53] Diana:
For the demo, we should show:

WhatsApp deep analysis

Q&A: “Who is doing API integration?”

Unified dashboard view

[02:06] Charlie:
Agreed. Also Discord—UI is ready, but backend isn’t done. Should we hide it or show "Coming Soon"?

[02:15] Alice:
Keep it as “Planned”. Judges love roadmap clarity.

[02:21] Bob:
The Gemini API rotation with three keys now supports 180 requests per minute. This is a big selling point.

[02:33] Diana:
Yep. And pgvector search is insanely fast. I tested with 2000 embeddings, queries still resolve under 100 ms.

[02:44] Charlie:
Speaking of embeddings—should we upgrade to 1024-dim? Or stay with 768?

[02:50] Bob:
Stay with 768 for now. It’s cheaper, faster, and good enough semantically.

[02:57] Alice:
Alright. Next—UI. Shader background looks awesome but slightly heavy on low-end laptops.

[03:05] Diana:
We can enable GPU detection. If performance is low, fallback to static gradient.

[03:13] Charlie:
Smart. Also the retro theme is getting great reactions in my tests. Everyone loves it.

[03:20] Alice:
Good. For the pitch deck, let’s emphasize:

Unified multi-platform knowledge

RAG + pgvector

340 real WhatsApp chats

Production-ready features

[03:36] Bob:
We should also mention that users don’t need to change behavior. They continue using WhatsApp + Meets, and ContextAI just captures the meaning.

[03:48] Diana:
Yes! I’ll include that in the pitch script.

[03:52] Charlie:
Anything else before we wrap up?

[03:55] Alice:
Final item: We need a clean demo transcript sample for testing the Meets analyzer.

[04:02] Bob:
I’ll prepare a few mock transcripts today.

[04:06] Alice:
Perfect. Let’s reconvene tonight and rehearse the 3-minute pitch.

[04:12] All:
Agreed.
